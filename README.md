This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue within a `setTimeout` loop.  The provided `bug.js` file contains code that unexpectedly prints the number 10 ten times instead of printing the numbers 0 through 9 sequentially with a one-second delay.  The solution, `bugSolution.js`, illustrates how to correctly handle closures in this scenario using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to capture the value of `i` at each iteration.
